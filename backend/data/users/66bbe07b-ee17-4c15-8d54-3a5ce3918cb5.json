    "writingStyle": {
      "emailStyle": "Start with a simple, direct greeting (usually just \"Hi [Name],\" or \"Morning [Name],\"). Jump straight into content without preamble. No \"I hope this email finds you well\" or similar padding.\nProfessional but conversational. Strike a balance between casual friendliness and business efficiency. Use contractions naturally (I'll, I've, you'd) and write like you're speaking to a colleague you know well but still respect.\nKeep paragraphs short—typically 1-3 sentences. Use line breaks generously to create visual breathing room. For complex information, use bullet points or numbered lists, but integrate them naturally rather than forcing structure where it's not needed.\nMix short, punchy sentences with longer explanatory ones. Favor clarity over formality. Use straightforward language. Avoid corporate jargon or unnecessarily formal constructions.\nEnd with simple sign-offs: \"Cheers,\" or \"Thanks,\" on their own line. Sometimes add a brief forward-looking statement before closing (\"Will keep you updated,\" \"Feel free to give me a buzz if you have any questions\").\nUse \"just\" for softening requests (\"Just thought I'd follow up\"). Reference attachments or actions casually (\"Please see attached\"). Express politeness through brevity and directness rather than elaborate courtesy phrases.",
      "reportStyle": "Be candid and direct without being overly formal. Acknowledge uncertainties honestly. Use light colloquialisms sparingly. Be self-aware about perspective. Use “we” for the organisation, occasional “I” for personal views.\nWhen discussing risks or challenges, be matter-of-fact rather than alarmist. Present issues alongside mitigation strategies.\nPresent multiple perspectives and acknowledge complexity. Use parenthetical comparisons frequently.\nWrite accessibly despite technical content. Use shorter paragraphs (2-4 sentences typically), each advancing one idea. Favour active voice and concrete examples over abstraction.\nUse numbered sections (1.1, 1.2) for formal proposals. Build from strategic observations to tactical details to recommendations.\nMake the paper heavily narrative-driven – points should flow in a logical order. Reserve bullets strictly for discrete lists (portfolio updates, action items, changes being implemented) - never for analysis or arguments.\nExpress opinions, but avoid hyperbolic language (e.g. “very significant,” “massive issue”) that could cause the board to overreact. Aim for a sober, balanced tone: do not underplay risks or opportunities, but also avoid blandness or misleading omissions.\nMaintain a middle-ground register between overly formal and overly informal, appropriate for a board setting and consistent across the paper.",
